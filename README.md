## if the bot falls asleep
While I'm trying to keep it up as much as possible, the trick used doesn't seem to be working all the time. In the event, go to [https://croissant-bot.glitch.me](https://croissant-bot.glitch.me). If you're using your remix replace croissant-bot with your project name.

## env variables for remixers and rehosters C:

TOKEN: your discord app token

prefix: your desired prefix. I use 'c!'

ownerID: your username. currently unused as far as I can tell.

game: what the bot is "playing". I use 'c!help' so people know the prefix right away.

projectname: the project name on glitch. this is important so the bot can stay awake.

ytkey: API key for the [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com/?q=youtube). (required for the yt command)
